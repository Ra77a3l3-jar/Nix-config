## üåü Introduction

Welcome to my personal NixOS configuration! This repository contains a complete, modular, and reproducible setup for a development and gaming machine. It's designed to be easily maintainable and extensible, with a strong focus on providing a seamless and efficient user experience.

This configuration is built upon the power of Nix Flakes, ensuring that the entire system can be replicated with a single command. Whether you're a developer, a gamer, or just a NixOS enthusiast, you'll find something to love in this setup.

## üíæ Installation

> **Warning:** This configuration is highly personalized. Please review the code and adapt it to your needs before using it.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Nix-config /etc/nixos
    cd /etc/nixos
    ```

2.  **Generate hardware configuration:**
    ```bash
    sudo nixos-generate-config --root /mnt
    ```
    > **Note:** This will create a `hardware-configuration.nix` file. You may need to merge it with the existing one.

3.  **Customize the configuration:**
    *   Edit `flake.nix` to match your system's architecture if it's not `x86_64-linux`.
    *   Modify `configuration.nix` and `home.nix` to suit your preferences. Pay close attention to the user and home directory settings.

4.  **Build and switch to the new configuration:**
    ```bash
    sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#nixos
    ```
